        <p className="about_text">
        Experimental electronic artist Boom Christopher Paige knew from a young age that his purpose in life was to create. 
        He's spent his lifetime honing his own unique sound, and now arriving with his latest offering to the audience
        aching to be challenged.</p>
        <p className="about_text">Born on the 4th of July, while the sky was lit up with fireworks (hence the nickname “Boom”), the 
        Philadelphia-based musician demonstrated an affinity for music from the time he was a child, thanks to 
        his upbringing in a family that favored the arts. Surrounded by all genres of music, from disco to jazz 
        to opera, his imagination soared, and his voracious appetite for the expressive medium continued to grow.</p>
        <p className="about_text">Boom spent the majority of the ‘90s as a core member of the electro-punk band <a href="https://www.westword.com/music/burn-baby-burn-5058028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Society Burning</a>, crafting 
        guitar and keyboard-heavy tracks that were driven by intense drops, but just as he started to find his way 
        in the music industry, his life was turned upside down when he was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma 
        in the mid-90s. However, rather than letting his diagnosis hinder his aspirations, he continued to move 
        forward, remixing for a handful of bands in the dark electronic world. These experiences sparked a fire 
        within him to pursue a career as a solo artist, and in 2013, he signed with the New York-based label 
        Teknofonic Recordings, releasing a handful of experimental singles and EPs, including his 2015 album 
        “<a href="https://www.beatport.com/release/house-for-serial-killers/1649224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">House for Serial Killers</a>.”</p>
        <p className="about_text">Gathering inspiration from artists like Duran Duran and Imogen Heap, Boom’s sound has been likened to 
        musicians like Daft Punk, Plaid, and Boards of Canada. In a testament to his nickname, his tracks explode with riveting 
        energy, bending and breaking the rules through intentional arrangement choices, making use of random 
        notes and off-kilter rhythms to create ethereal soundscapes that leave the listener wondering what to 
        expect next. “I make music for people that love music beyond the social aspects,” he explains, “who 
        insert themselves into the songs they hear.”</p>
        <p className="about_text">Boom has released his latest album “<a href="https://boomchrpaige.bandcamp.com/album/membranes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Membranes</a>,” which explores a non-musical concept—the COVID-19 
        pandemic—in an unconventional way. Designed specifically for presentation on vinyl, the album consists 
        of two sides, with the first conveying the uncertainty and naive optimism the world experienced during 
        the beginning of the crisis, and the second side providing a darker contrast, instead focusing on the 
        trauma and brokenness that reverberated internationally as the pandemic worsened and impacted daily life.</p>
